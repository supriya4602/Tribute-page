        <h4>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was the founder of the Maratha Empire.
            Chh. Shivajiraje Bhosale was born in the Shivneri Fort in Maharashtra on 19 February 1630 to mother
            Raajmata Jijabai and father Shri.Shahajiraje Bhosale. It is said that mother Jijabai prayed to Lord Shiva in
            Shivneri
            Fort for a brave son and kept her son name as Shivaji after the Hindu god Shiva.</h4>
        </p>
        <p>
        <h4>Shivaji was born in the hill-fort of Shivneri, near the city of Junnar, which is now in Pune district.
            Scholars disagree on his date of birth. The Government of Maharashtra lists 19 February as a holiday
            commemorating
            Shivaji's birth (Shivaji Jayanti).Shivaji was named after a local deity, the goddess Shivai. Shivaji's
            father Shahaji Bhonsle
            was a Maratha general who served the Deccan Sultanates. His mother was Jijabai the daughter of Lakhuji
            Jadhavrao of Sindhkhed, a Mughal-aligned sardar claiming descent from a Yadav royal family of Devagiri</h4>

        <h3 class="t">Shivaji Maharaj's mode of warfare</h3><br>
        <h4> maintained a small but effective standing army. The core of Shivaji's army consisted of
            peasants of the Maratha and Kunbi castes.Shivaji was aware of the limitations of his army.
            He realised that conventional warfare methods were inadequate to confront the big, well-trained cavalry of
            the
            Mughals which was equipped with field artillery. As a result, Shivaji adopted guerilla tactics which became
            known as
            'Ganimi Kawa'.Shivaji was a master of guerrilla warfare.[156] His strategies consistently perplexed and
            defeated armies sent against him. He realized that the most vulnerable point of the large, slow-moving
            armies
            of the time was supply. He utilised knowledge of the local terrain and the superior mobility of his light
            cavalry to
            cut off supplies to the enemy.[157] Shivaji refused to confront in pitched battles. Instead, he lured the
            enemies in
            difficult hills and jungles of his own choosing, catching them at a disadvantage and routing them.
            Shivaji didn't stick to a particular tactic but used several methods to undermine his enemies as
            required by circumstances, like sudden raids, sweeps and ambushes and use of psychological pressur</h4>

        <h3 class="t1">Leadership Lessons from the Legend of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj-</h3>
        <p>
        <h4>1. We over Me</h4>
        </p>
        <p>
        <h4>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, always believed on one philosophy, of We over Me.
            He not only believed that but, also always practiced it during many critical incidents.
            He displayed immense ease in exhibiting team spirit, which helped him lead the team in critical difficult
            situations of life and death</h4>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        <h4> 2. Practicing over Preaching</h4>
        </p>

        <p>
        <h4>He always believed in practicing over mere preaching. Rather then instructing anyone about some principle,
            he always lived it through his daily life. There were many instance where he needed the team to lead their
            lives to be sacrificed for the Matrubhumi/ Mother Land, in such cases he was the first one to do so.</h4>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        <h4> 3. Leading from the front Over Instructing from the back</h4>
        </p>

        <p>
        <h4>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj always led every task to governing or warfare, from the front i.e. being the
            front leader to participate, rather then being just an instructor and staying back. This he proved in many
            occasions such as winning many forts of his time, which were considered impossible.</h4>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        <h4> 4. Innovation over Tradition</h4>
        </p>

        <p>
        <h4> His war strategies and governing strategies always carried the touch of innovativeness. Looking at the
            limited resource always faced during his lifetime, he always believed in effective utilisation of people and
            any natural resource including warfare material and weapons. His warfare style and governing style has been
            always the topic of research for all military related and governance related topics of research, needless to
            say also for the competitive strategies in business as well.</h4>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        <h4> 5. Entrustment over Encroachment</h4>
        </p>

        <p>
        <h4> Once he entrusted any activity to anyone, he always trusted him or her fully. he never encroached in his
            work,
            rather awaited for the person to respond back. He always alllowed anyone to commit mistakes, so that the
            fear of failure,
            goes off and fearlessness could be established along side the warrior attitude. The reason of this was that
            he could
            percolate the vision in hearts of all mates.</h4>
